This code needs a lot of work.  The goal for me was a quick interface to access some basic switches and wall outlets
from my Raspberry Pi.

First step is to get open-zwave(http://code.google.com/p/open-zwave/) compiled on your device.  I wrote a quick blog
about it http://thomasloughlin.com/z-wave-controller-setup-on-my-raspberry-pi/

Also worth taking a look at: https://github.com/tagroup/php-zwave-christmas-socket-client
and http://thomasloughlin.com/new-open-zwave-image-for-raspberry-pi/

http://conradvassallo.com/category/open-zwave-controller/ is working on an almost identical project but has a better ui.

Few notes:
1. I have noticed that the higher the node number of the devices, the slower the response (or polled) message is.  I
think this is to be expected.
2. With my simple client, some of the high number nodes will not update in time before the page reloads (even with a 1-2
second sleep).  The better solution would be AJAX polling for the latest status.
